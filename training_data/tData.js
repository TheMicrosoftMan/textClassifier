    input: "When the Sun formed out of a molecular cloud, it swept up most of the material in the cloud, leaving a little left over for everything else: planets, asteroids, and comets",

    input: "So far, so good, since the early Solar System was a much more chaotic place than it is now",
    output: "science"
}, {
    input: "As asteroids and comets struck this hot Earth, the water and the hydrogen in it were boiled off into space",
    output: "science"
}, {
    input: "As the Earth cooled over time, water from comet and asteroid collisions was allowed to condense on Earth, and not be boiled off into space",

    input: "The evidence for this lies in isotope ratios",

}, {
    input: "Two bodies of water with the same ratio must have the same origin, the thinking goes",
